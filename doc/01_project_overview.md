# Project Overview – Quran Revision MVP

This project is a **Quran revision assistant for Huffaz**, built as a logic-first MVP.

The goal is to help a Hafiz revise Qur’an **hands-free**, without opening a Mushaf
or relying on another person.

The app listens to recitation and detects:
- Missing words
- Wrong or uncertain words
- Skipped words
- Getting stuck or pausing

This is an MVP focused on **correct logic and data collection**, not full tajweed
or final accuracy yet.
